# XCharge

XCharge™ is a fast charging enhancement magisk module.

## Explanation

The main function of **XCharge™** is to mutate `/sys/class/power_supply/battery/constant_charge_current_max` tunable. So, that we can change the power supply to battery which allows us to improve fast charging for a specified device. It also modifies temperature related tunables which allows us to change the temperature limit at which charging will be slow down by system. It has a Menu through which we can make use of the above mentioned functions. To access the Menu, type `su -c xcharge` in Termux or any other terminal emulator. It has three modes i.e Fast, Faster & Fastest. Related info about modes is given in the Menu.
